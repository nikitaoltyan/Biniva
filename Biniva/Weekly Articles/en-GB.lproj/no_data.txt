Biniva tries to build individual tips for you, but nothing comes out due to a lack of data. Perhaps not enough time has passed for analysis yet? <tab>Try to record the garbage you create for at least a week, and then be sure to come back! Biniva will form a board specifically for you, you just need to wait for a little. <tab>And don't forget that all your data remains on the device and is not transferred anywhere. Biniva will process them here, without requests to the server. This way they will be protected.
