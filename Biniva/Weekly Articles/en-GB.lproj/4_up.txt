So you threw out the glass last week. There is nothing wrong with this if you have found a place on the Biniva map where you can take your garbage for recycling. <tab>Using glass is not a bad thing, because if you hand over a glass bottle, it will not even necessarily be melted down. Perhaps they will just wash it and use it again.
