Biniva's sorry you had to throw away the batteries last week. Biniva believes in your consciousness and that you did not just throw them in the trash, but took them to a place where they will be taken care of. <tab>Try to replace disposable batteries with batteries that can be charged and reused many more times. This way you will reduce your carbon footprint and pollute the Earth less with chemical waste.
