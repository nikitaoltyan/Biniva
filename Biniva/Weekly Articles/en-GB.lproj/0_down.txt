You are the best person on the Earth, Biniva believes in it! Last week you threw away less plastic than two weeks ago, which means you have already started your way to reduce its consumption. Time will pass and the oceans and forests will be cleaned of this human waste. Always remember that it was you who put your hand to the beautiful green world of the future. Keep it up!
