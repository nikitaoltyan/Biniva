Biniva's sorry you had to throw away the light bulb last week. Biniva believes in your consciousness and that you did not just throw it in the trash, but took it to a place where it will be taken care of. <tab>Remember that instead of conventional incandescent lamps, it is better to use energy-saving or LED lamps (they are the most environmentally friendly and can last up to 30 years). And, of course, it is better to always monitor your consumption. The best light is solar! Why turn on the lamps when you can do without them? The planet will say thank you.
