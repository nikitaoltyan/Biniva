It's a little sad that you threw out more papers last week than you did two weeks ago. Biniva hopes that you did the right thing with this garbage and took it to recycle. <tab>The main thing is to hand over cardboard or unnecessary sheets of paper to a special place so that the materials suitable for further use as fibrous raw materials will once again serve people. <tab>But not all paper needs to be processed in the same way. Beware of tetra packs (packages of juices and milk) — they must be handed over separately. But dirty or greasy paper products should be composted — for example, used napkins or craft paper in which the burger was wrapped. <tab>And to process paper, you need twice as much water as to create a new one. Your ability to sort waste paper and take it to the right places for disposal is something that you can be proud of yourself!
