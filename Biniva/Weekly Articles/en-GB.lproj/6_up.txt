Biniva is sad that you had to mark the clothes as discarded material last week. <tab>If you need new things – look at local brands with small production, offering high-quality clothing made of eco-friendly materials. <tab>And if you need to get rid of something – there is always a Biniva map that will help you find a place for recycling delivery of things (and sometimes it's charity shops. Giving clothes a new life – is it a bad thing?)
