Speaking of clothes. Unfortunately, every year millions of tons of clothing around the world end up in a landfill. This is facilitated by fast fashion and trends. Things are often made of poor quality to increase their consumption and corporate profits. This is a negative and wasteful cycle, please find the strength not to be a participant in it.
