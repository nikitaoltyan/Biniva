In this tab, Biniva algorithms will form tips and recommendations for you every week based on the garbage you have recorded. Thus, your movement to Zero Waste will become easier! <tab>Don't worry, all your data will remain on the device and will not be transferred anywhere. Biniva will process them on the device, without requests to the server. Thus, all your data will be completely protected and will not be able to fall into the wrong hands in any way (even Biniva team). <tab>Unfortunately, Biniva cannot create tips for you because you are not subscribed. The proceeds go to maintaining the map with recycling points, attracting new users to the Zero Waste movement, and developing new features (like these advices). By subscribing to the Biniva project, you will help nature.
